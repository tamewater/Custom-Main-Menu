# Custom Main Menu for Garry's Mod

## Installation
1. Download. Click the green "Code" button and click "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the files from the .zip you downloaded.
3. Right click Garry's Mod in your steam library and click "Properties..."
4. Click the "Local files" tab and then click "Browse local files..."
5. A file explorer window should appear after step 4. If so, navigate to the "garrysmod" folder.
6. Move the "gamemodes", "html", and "materials" folders into the "garrysmod" folder. You will get a notification about overwriting files. Just overwrite them.
7. Done!

## Uninstallation
There are two ways, an easy but sloppy way. Or a more difficult, but cleaner way of uninstalling this.

First way (Easy but sloppy):
1. Right click Garr'y Mod in steam and click "Properties..."
2. Click the "Local files" tab and the click "Verify integrity of game files..."
3. Done! Due to there being extra files within this project. They will not be removed from the game and will sit there taking space. Hence the reason for it being sloppy. 

Second way (More difficult but cleaner):
1. Do steps 3-5 in the installation steps.
2. Delete the "gamemodes", "html", and "materials" folders from the "garrysmod" folder.
3. If steam has not already started re-downloading files. Right click Garry's Mod in steam and click "Properties..."
4. Click the "Local files" tab and then click "Verify integriy of game files..."
5. Done! All files to do with this main menu are now removed and Garry's Mod should be back to the way it was (Unless you installed other custom content to those folders of course. In that case, they're gone).
